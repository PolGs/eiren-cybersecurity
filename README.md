Eiren's SOC Vision:

With cyber-attacks increasing in frequency and sophistication, it is more important than ever to proactively hunt down threats and mitigate breaches as early as possible. However, for many organisations, setting up a dedicated in-house security operations centre to address these risks 24/7 is simply not viable. Thanks to the use of open source technology and reasonably priced security ptoducts our Virtual Security Operations Centre service provides affordable enterprise-grade threat detection and response for businesses of all sizes.
